## What is OGC API - EDR


The OGC API for Environmental Data Retrieval (EDR) stands at the forefront of modern geospatial data dissemination, facilitating seamless access and exchange of environmental information across diverse platforms and applications. By adhering to standardized protocols and leveraging RESTful principles, OGC API EDR streamlines the retrieval and sharing of environmental data, empowering stakeholders to harness geospatial insights for informed decision-making and sustainable resource management. Its modular architecture and adherence to open standards foster interoperability, enabling developers to integrate disparate datasets and unlock new avenues for environmental analysis and monitoring. As a pivotal component of the Open Geospatial Consortium's (OGC) evolving ecosystem, OGC API EDR embodies a commitment to democratizing access to environmental data, fostering collaboration, and advancing the frontiers of geospatial innovation.
